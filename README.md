# HeretechsUtil
A Minecraft 1.17 server plugin for my friends and me to make the game more difficult/interesting the longer you play. Tasks are given to players to incentivize and reward different play styles, with the reward being points that can be used to get items that may help in a tight spot, or can give an extra boost in the early game.
